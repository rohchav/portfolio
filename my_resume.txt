PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Washington Software Inc, Gaithersburg, MD

CloudOps Workflow Integration (October 2025 – Present)

Built and deployed automated data and email monitoring pipelines in Microsoft Power Automate and Azure, integrating chatbot logic for classification and case management
Led cross-environment rollout of the Bridge Program inquiry system across internal domains, managing 5+ Jira sprints and 15+ user stories to ensure reliable deployment and testing
Ergodic LLC, Seattle, WA

Plasma Parameter Estimation (February 2025 – Present)

Refactored object-oriented configuration logic across four simulation modules, enforcing coding standards and reducing code duplication by 40% within a CI/CD pipeline
Diagnosed and resolved 75% of unit/integration test failures, reinforcing test-driven development practices and stabilizing simulation infrastructure
Interacted with Tesseract-core modules (Docker containers) hosted on cloud infrastructure, leveraging Linux/Unix Shell to manage simulation outputs and analyze data
Collaborative Design Experience, East Lansing, MI

Increasing Simulation Variety for Self-Driving Environments (September 2024 – December 2024)

Developed computer vision–style simulation assets in Unreal Engine and Carla to automate perception pipelines for autonomous driving systems, supporting synthetic data generation and scalable ML testing environments
Created a reusable bulk-processing tool with probabilistic asset variation (scale, texture, rotation) and a save/load feature integrating XML, reducing manual setup time by 90%
Led weekly design reviews consulting with stakeholders; consolidated 10+ tools into a unified UI panel and ensured secure demo deployment under tight deadlines
Collaborated in an Agile team with GitHub for version control, participating in sprint planning, code reviews, and secure deployment workflows, and providing technical documentation
Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI

Undergraduate Research & Projects (September 2021 – December 2024)

Served as undergraduate research assistant on MCMC graph-compression, tuning hyperparameters to downscale real-world networks by 25–75% while preserving key statistical properties
Architected a Random Forest classifier leveraging scikit-learn models training on three seasons of NFL data (team of 4) deploying SQL queries, predicting game outcomes at 80% accuracy, and surfacing key insights
Built a CNN in Python (team of 4) using TensorFlow/Keras to classify 10 hand-drawn sketch categories at 70% test accuracy; developed a NumPy pipeline (28×28 resize, grayscale) boosting validation
Engineered a modular C++/wxWidgets animation tool with Box2D physics integration; applied object-oriented design patterns and oversaw full development lifecycle
PROJECTS

Multi-Scale Bio Simulator

Constructed a front-end bio-sim MVP that streams typed quantum/chemical events into a live React sandbox for instant environment feedback: link
Delivered an H–H orbital visualizer with Heitler–London σ/σ* sampling, phase-colored particles, and cached marching-cubes density for rapid bonding insight
Laid the pipeline using prompt engineering on Claude Code to scale toward full-stack (C++ backend and Javascript frontend), multi-electron atoms, richer bonding models, and cell-level simulations to deepen research and teaching scenarios
You Know Ball

Engineered large-scale ML pipeline ingesting 23K+ game records across 18 seasons using pandas and PostgreSQL, training LightGBM ensembles — demonstrating scalable model deployment and data pipeline management
Trained calibrated LightGBM ensembles on time-aware splits reaching 0.751 AUC, 0.593 log loss, and 0.203 Brier on the holdout set
